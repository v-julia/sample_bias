# sample_bias

This folder contains scripts that we used to process data for the paper "The effect of sample bias and experimental artifacts on statistical phylogenetic analysis of picornaviruses."

## fetch_date.py

Gets modification and collection dates from GenBank files defined in script. Plots graph and histogram of dates frequency distribution for each GenBank file.

## random_sample.py

Generates random samples with number of sequences *n_seq_max* the following way:

* All sequences in the reference alignment are partitioned into groups by
the first *threshold* characters of the GenBank ID.
* Then the random group is chosen, and all sequences from this group are
added to alignment. This step is repeated until the number of sequences reaches
*n_seq_max*.

### usage

```
usage: random_sample.py [-h] -input INPUT_FILE [-out_dir OUTPUT_DIR] -n_samp
                        N_SAMPLES -n_seq_max N_SEQ_MAX -threshold THRESHOLD

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -input INPUT_FILE, --input_file INPUT_FILE
                        Input file
  -out_dir OUTPUT_DIR, --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Output directory to save generated alignments
  -n_samp N_SAMPLES, --n_samples N_SAMPLES
                        Number of random alignments to generate
  -n_seq_max N_SEQ_MAX, --n_seq_max N_SEQ_MAX
                        Number of sequences in generated alignment
  -threshold THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD
                        Input file
```

## get_rate.py

Derives tree's branch substitution rates from tree-file in nexus format (output of TreeAnnotator program). Saves derived rates and logarithms of rates into "rates.txt" file located in output_dir. Plots histograms of rates and log rates showing mean rate and mean + (1,2,3)sd as vertical lines.

### usage

```
usage: get_rate.py [-h] -input INPUT_FILE [-out_dir OUTPUT_DIR] -t TITLE -f
                   FORMAT

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -input INPUT_FILE, --input_file INPUT_FILE
                        Input file with tree-file generated by TreeAnnotator
  -out_dir OUTPUT_DIR, --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Output directory to save generated alignments
  -t TITLE, --title TITLE
                        Title for plot
  -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
                        format of figure
```
